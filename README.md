# Advent of code 2021!

So this year I decided to properly participate in the yearly [AdventOfCode Coding Challenges](https://adventofcode.com/)!

Originally I intended to solve the daily challenges in React with Typescript. But I soon realized that I did not nearly have enough time to properly develop UIs for them!
Also some were not really easily visualized anyway ~

Therefore I switched to Kotlin and it's been a lovely experience so far! 
My solutions being not that clean etc. but I've learned a lot!


## TL;DR My takeaway this year:
When in doubt - use maps :D

StackOverflow -> Maps
OutOfMemory -> Maps
